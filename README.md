## Usage

To use the ALNA Jekyll theme:

1. Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    gem "alna-jekyll-theme"
    ```

2. And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

    ```yaml
    theme: alna-jekyll-theme
    ```

## Customizing

### Configuration variables

ALNA jekyll theme will respect the following variables, if set in your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
title: [The title of your site]
subtitle: [The subtitle of your site]
description: [A short description of your site's purpose]
twitter_username: [Your twitter user name]
author:
  name: [The author name of your site]
  avatar: [The url author avatar]
  avatar2x: [The url author avatar@2x]
  avatar_alt: [The author avatar alt]
  bio: [A short author bio]
```

Additionally, you may choose to set the following optional variables:

```yml
about: [A short description about your site]
copyright: [The copyright of your site]
social_media:
  - name: [The social media name as twitter, facebook and github]
    link: [The social media url]
```

### Stylesheet

If you'd like to add your own custom styles:

1. Create a file called `/assets/css/style.scss` in your site
2. Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown:
    ```scss
    ---
    ---

    @import "{{ site.theme }}";
    ```
3. Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you'd like immediately after the `@import` line

### Layouts

If you'd like to change the theme's HTML layout:

1. [Copy the original template](https://github.com/abel-nieva/alna-jekyll-theme/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) from the theme's repository<br />(*Pro-tip: click "raw" to make copying easier*)
2. Create a file called `/_layouts/default.html` in your site
3. Paste the default layout content copied in the first step
4. Customize the layout as you'd like

### Enabling comments (via Disqus)

Optionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post.

To enable it, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
disqus:
  shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

You can find out more about Disqus' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208).

Comments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`

If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.

### Enabling Google Analytics

To enable Google Anaytics, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
google_analytics: UA-NNNNNNNN-N
```

Google Analytics will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`
